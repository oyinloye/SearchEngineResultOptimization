Find source reliability by counting inversions during sorting

By: Dapo Oyinloye.

#A program in python that checks the reliability of search engines result rankings. The steps are:
# 1) Reads the data from the file.
# 2) Stores them in their respective arrays.
# 3) Adds the contents from the corresponding indexes in the array and stores in an array.
# 4) Sorts the combined array and sorts the sources 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 with the indexes from the cobined array.
# 6) Individually sorts the sorted file and check inversions for comparisions implementing different algorithms.
